# Welcome to the Web4 Agent Protocol Wiki

# !!! DRAFT !!! TBD

**The Web4 Agent Protocol redefines the user-web interface.** It is a forward-looking, open standard designed to create a new, symbiotic relationship between users, their AI Agents (powered by LLMs), and the open web.

### The Problem
Modern LLMs are powerful, but they often act as a barrier between users and websites. They aggregate information, which is useful, but they lack the ability to perform meaningful **actions** on the user's behalf. This limits their utility and threatens the economic models that support the web's creators.

### The Solution: A New User-Web Experience
Instead of replacing the web, the Web4 Agent Protocol seamlessly integrates with it. It provides a standardized framework that allows any website to securely expose its core functionality.

This transforms AI Agents from simple information retrievers into powerful personal assistants for the web. A user can now not only *ask* about flights but can *book* them, not just read a review but *buy* the productâ€”all through a single, secure, conversational interface.

### Benefits of the Web4 Agent Protocol

*   **For Users:** Enjoy a seamless, unified experience. Buy products, book services, and access content from any website through your AI Agent, all while using your existing website accounts securely.
*   **For Publishers:** Create new, direct revenue streams through microtransactions and optimized advertising, independent of site traffic. Integration is simplified by placing an intelligent gateway in front of your existing API, not by rewriting it.
*   **For Advertisers:** Pay only for verifiably engaged user attention in a transparent, on-chain ecosystem.
