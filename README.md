# Welcome to the Web4 Agent Protocol Wiki

# !!! DRAFT !!! TBD

**The Web4 Agent Protocol redefines the user-web interface.** It is a forward-looking, open standard designed to create a new, symbiotic relationship between users, their AI Agents (powered by LLMs), and the open web.

### The Problem

Modern LLMs are powerful, but they often act as a barrier between users and websites. They aggregate information, which is useful, but they lack the ability to perform meaningful **actions** on the user's behalf. This limits their utility and threatens the economic models that support the web's creators.

### The Solution: A New User-Web Experience

The Web4 Agent Protocol integrates with the existing web rather than replacing it, providing a standardized framework for websites to securely expose their core functionality.

This transforms AI Agents from simple information retrievers into powerful personal assistants. A user can now not only _ask_ about flights but also _book_ them, not just read a review but also _buy_ the product—all through a single, secure, conversational interface.

Envisioned as an evolution—akin to MCP 2.0—for seamless daily web interactions, the protocol will integrate authentication and payment capabilities into the agent's core. This creates a unified experience where the agent securely manages user identity and transactions across services, becoming a trusted assistant for the user's entire web presence.

### Benefits of the Web4 Agent Protocol

- **For Users:** Enjoy a seamless, unified experience. Buy products, book services, and access content from any website through your AI Agent, all while using your existing website accounts securely.
- **For Publishers:** Create new, direct revenue streams through microtransactions and optimized advertising, independent of site traffic. Integration is simplified by placing an intelligent gateway in front of your existing API, not by rewriting it.
- **For Advertisers:** Pay only for verifiably engaged user attention in a transparent, on-chain ecosystem.
